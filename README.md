## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Android Studio application.

- This project is a very basic project that I'll recommend for a beginner Android developer.
- This a simple login and sign up mobile app with home page added to it.
- It was implemented with buttons to navigate from login page to signup page and also to home page.
